## Introduction
This web page was created to serve as a web development portfolio. The linked applications in the portfolio, as well as the web page itself, serve as an example of the developer's skills in front end development. The challenge included a model web page to use for the structure of the assignment.

## HTML and CSS Challenge

This challenge utilized HTML and CSS to create a functional portfolio. The user will notice that there is responsive design in the nav links, work image links, and contact info links. The user will also notice that the web page responds to the size of various devices, and remains functional and aestetically pleasing when the display size changes.
